**Can't Stop Express Rules**

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to accumulate the highest number of points by choosing the best combination of two pairs from five dice rolled and making a good choice for the fifth die.[^9†source]

2. **Game Play**: On your turn, roll five dice. All players will use the same dice throw for the turn. You have to decide, in your mind, which 4 dice to use to make two pairs, and which die to use as the "5th die".[^10†source]

3. **The "5th Die" Rule**: In each of the first three turns, you must select a unique "5th die" to add to your chart and mark its use. Once you have three unique "5th die" numbers, you must use one of these three numbers for each throw if one of those numbers is available. If a throw does not contain one of your three chosen numbers, you have a "free throw" where the "5th die" does not need to be chosen.[^11†source]

4. **Scoring**: You're awarded points based on the number of times a pair value is filled in:
   - Minus 200 points are awarded for each value/row filled in only one, two, three, or four times.
   - 0 points are awarded for each value/row filled in exactly five times or none at all.
   - Plus points are awarded for each value that has been filled in at least six times. For the sixth to tenth boxes in a row, you're awarded plus points. Each filled-in box (6-10) gets the value of the points that appear in column A.[^13†source]

5. **End of the Game**: The game ends for a player once they have filled in the eighth box for one of their values of the "5th die". For other players, the game ends when they have also crossed the "5th die" for the eighth time for one of their three "5th box" numbers.[^12†source]

6. **Winner**: If more than one player is playing, the player with the most plus points wins. If you're playing alone, always note your best score and try to beat it in subsequent games.[^14†source]
